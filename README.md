# Personal AlgoBot
This project was a project done by Daniel Jiang, Jodie Zhu and Eric Liu. Throughout the Jupyter Notebook, we have made various comments on how the code works. But to 
give an overall outlook onto the project, it is our personal method to develop a portfolio of 20 stocks so that we will have close to 0% return (thereby creating a safe portfolio).
